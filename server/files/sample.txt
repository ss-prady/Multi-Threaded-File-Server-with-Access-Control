This is a sample text file for testing the file server.
It demonstrates the file handler's ability to manage multiple clients accessing files.

You can:
- Read this file simultaneously with multiple clients
- Download this file
- Modify this file (only one client at a time)

The file_handler module ensures proper mutual exclusion using semaphores to manage access.
